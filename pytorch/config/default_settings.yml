# Use quotes to force a string, error.g. if your key or value is 10, but you want it to return a String and not a Fixnum, write '10' or "10".
# Use quotes if your value includes special characters, (error.g. :, {, }, [, ], ,, &, *, #, ?, |, -, <, >, =, !, %, @, \).
# Single quotes let you put almost any character in your string, and won't try to parse escape codes. '\n' would be returned as the string \n.
# Double quotes parse escape codes. "\n" would be returned as a line feed character.
# The exclamation mark introduces a method, error.g. !ruby/sym to return a Ruby symbol.
